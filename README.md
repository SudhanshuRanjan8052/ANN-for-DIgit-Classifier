# ANN-for-DIgit-Classifier

This is an digit classifier Artificial Neural Network based on scikit-learn and MNIST dataset.
Accuracy Score: 0.97
Ihis model takes a 28*28 pixel grayscale photo.
I have provided one sample photo as five.png and on passing this image, the model predicts it correctly.
I have used a software named "GIMP" a graphic designing software for creating that image of five and i am provided a file "five.xcf" made by this software. we should export the photo as grayscale. At the time of creation of image, select 28*28 pixel.

And will keep trying to incerase the accuracy :)
